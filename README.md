# GladNet (Glader's Library of Advanced Development for Network Emulation Technologies)

Introducing GladNet4, the 4th generation of the .NET/C# GladNet networking library.
Originally designed for the niche of server/client network game emulation, GladNet has evolved into a generalized C#/.NET networking library, with a continued focus on games networking. GladNet4 offers a collection of APIs that enable developers to quickly build client or server software in .NET/C#. The library features an extendable API, supporting multiple cryptography schemes and serializers, making it highly adaptable.
